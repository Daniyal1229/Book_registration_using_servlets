# BOOK REGISTRATION SYSTEM USING JAVA SERVLETS
The Book Registration Form is a database-driven online application that stores and manages information about books. It is designed with a blend of client-side front-end technologies such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap and server-side Java Servlet. The information is saved in a MySQL database that is controlled by a Tomcat server
<b>
To execute the Book Registration Form project, you'll need to follow several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:</b>
<i>
Set up the development environment:

Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and configure it with your IDE.
Install a web server such as Apache Tomcat and configure it with your IDE.
Set up the database:

Install MySQL database server.
Create a new database for the Book Registration Form project.
Create the necessary tables to store book information.
Create the project structure:

Create a new project in your IDE.
Set up the directory structure for the project, including separate folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java files.
Design the front-end:

Create an HTML form to capture book information such as title, author, ISBN, etc.
Use CSS and Bootstrap to style the form and make it visually appealing.
Implement the client-side validation:

Use JavaScript to validate the form inputs on the client side.
Ensure that all required fields are filled, and the data is in the correct format.
Implement the server-side:

Create a Java Servlet that handles the form submission and interacts with the database.
In the Servlet, establish a connection to the MySQL database using JDBC.
Retrieve the form data from the request parameters and perform any necessary server-side validation.
Insert the book information into the database using SQL queries.
Configure the web server:

Deploy your application to the Apache Tomcat server.
Configure the server to connect to the MySQL database.
Test the application:

Start the Tomcat server and access the Book Registration Form application in a web browser.
