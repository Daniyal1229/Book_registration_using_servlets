# BOOK REGISTRATION SYSTEM USING JAVA SERVLETS
<br>
The Book Registration Form is a database-driven online application that stores and manages information about books. It is designed with a blend of client-side front-end technologies such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap and server-side Java Servlet. The information is saved in a MySQL database that is controlled by a Tomcat server
<br>
<b>
To execute the Book Registration Form project, you'll need to follow several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:</b>
<i>
  <br>
Set up the development environment:
<br>
Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
    <br>
Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and configure it with your IDE.
    <br>
Install a web server such as Apache Tomcat and configure it with your IDE.
    <br>
Set up the database:
    <br>

Install MySQL database server.
    <br>
Create a new database for the Book Registration Form project.
    <br>
Create the necessary tables to store book information.
    <br>
Create the project structure:
    <br>

Create a new project in your IDE.
    <br>
Set up the directory structure for the project, including separate folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java files.
    <br>
Design the front-end:
    <br>

Create an HTML form to capture book information such as title, author, ISBN, etc.
    <br>
Use CSS and Bootstrap to style the form and make it visually appealing.
    <br>
Implement the client-side validation:
    <br>

Use JavaScript to validate the form inputs on the client side.
Ensure that all required fields are filled, and the data is in the correct format.
    <br>
Implement the server-side:
  <br>
Create a Java Servlet that handles the form submission and interacts with the database.
    <br>
In the Servlet, establish a connection to the MySQL database using JDBC.
    <br>
Retrieve the form data from the request parameters and perform any necessary server-side validation.
    <br>
Insert the book information into the database using SQL queries.
Configure the web server:
    <br>

Deploy your application to the Apache Tomcat server.
    <br>
Configure the server to connect to the MySQL database.
    <br>
Test the application:
    <br>

Start the Tomcat server and access the Book Registration Form application in a web browser.
